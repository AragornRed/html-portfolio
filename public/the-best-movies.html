<h1>The Best Movies According to Rafal</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all time</h2>
<hr />
<p>I must admit that I am not a huge movie fan. I mean I watched plenty of films over the years, however I always was
    much more into video games, books or music. So to make a list of even three movies, is a little bit hard for me (it
    would be a lot easier to make a list of the best 3 video games or rock/metal albums). Nevertheless if I have to
    choose than here's my list</p>
<h3>Star Wars (the Old Trilogy of course)</h3>
<p>Yes I know it should be only one movie, however for me THIS IS ONE GREATEST MOVIE OF ALL TIME. Trully masterpiece and
    I mean both - all three parts together and each one of them separetelly. I cannot say which one I like the most, all
    of them are on exact same level. I also like the prequel trilogy (sic!), however of course not that much as the old
    one. About the 3rd trilogy (you know - the one which starts with "Force Awakens" movie) - OMG, this is is an
    abomination of the whole franchise.</p>
<hr />
<h3>Back to the Future trilogy</h3>
<p>What else to say - the same as with Star Wars.</p>
<hr />
<h3>Spirited Away/Howl's Moving Castle</h3>
<p>I love anime and when it comes to full anime movies, there are no better specialists than Hayao Miyazaki and Studio
    Ghibli. I cannot really tell which one is better, however when you saw and liked Spirted Away, you should also watch
    Howl's Moving Castle.</p>
